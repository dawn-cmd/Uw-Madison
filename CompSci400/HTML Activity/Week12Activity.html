    <h1>Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm is a graph search algorithm that solves the single-source shortest path problem for a graph with non-negative edge weights, producing a shortest path tree.
    </p>

    <h2>Algorithm Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Create a set of unvisited nodes and a set of visited nodes, initially empty.</li>
        <li>Assign a tentative distance value to every node: set it to zero for the initial node and to infinity for all other nodes. Set the initial node as the current node.</li>
        <li>For the current node, calculate the tentative distance to each of its unvisited neighbors.</li>
        <li>Select the unvisited node with the smallest tentative distance, and set it as the new current node. Mark the current node as visited.</li>
        <li>Repeat steps 3 and 4 until all nodes have been visited or the target node has been visited.</li>
        <li>Construct the shortest path by tracing the path from the target node to the initial node in reverse order.</li>
    </ol>
